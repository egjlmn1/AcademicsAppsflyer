Academics
=================

Academics is a social app for students all around the world.
In Academics, students can ask questions, share suggestion, socialize with one another and find help.

Introduction
------------

The idea behind Academics is that during the COVID-19 time, students have hard time studying in online lectures.
So Academics helps students gather good and reliable material to study from (Like course summaries or, if needed, tests from previous years and different institutions),
and connects between students who need help and those who can provide the help.
