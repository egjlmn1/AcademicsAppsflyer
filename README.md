Academics
=================

Academics is a social app for students all around the world.
In Academics, students can ask questions, share suggestion, socialize with one another and find help.

Introduction
------------

The idea behind Academics is that during the COVID-19 time, students have hard time studying in online lectures.
So Academics helps students gather good and reliable material to study from (Like course summaries or, if needed, tests from previous years and different institutions),
and connects between students who need help and those who can provide the help.


Installation Instructions
---------------

There are two ways to install the application:

The first one is to download the Academics.apk to your android device and install it. (It's that simple.)

The second method is to download the source code and run it in android studio.
We suggest you install the application using the first method since the second one may be not reliable (you need to have android studio and a configured sdk in your system)

Both the apk and the source code can be found in our repository. The apk file is named "Academics.apk" and the source code it the folder named "Source Code"


Getting Started
---------------
To enter Academics you first need to sign up to the app.

Academics features
-----------------

The main feature of the app is the ability to share a post with others who may be interested in it.
The way we accomplished it is by making an hierarchy of folders containing faculty->department->course.
To share your post you need to select a folder where the post will be.
We have five types of posts:

Question - this post can sit in any folder, it will contain text or maybe an image that helps you describes your question.
Using our comment section, people can answer your question, ask a continuing question or get more understanding of what you ment.

Suggestion - this post

Meme - a joke, a confession or anything you can share that will help relieve the stress other students have during this hard times.
